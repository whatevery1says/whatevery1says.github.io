# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists look
like:

  - this one
  - that one
  - the other one

Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual text content
starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
> 
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s all in
chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode
is supported. ☺

## An h2 header

Here’s a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side).

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:
    
      - carrots
      - celery
      - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot.

Here’s a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header)..

A horizontal rule follows.
